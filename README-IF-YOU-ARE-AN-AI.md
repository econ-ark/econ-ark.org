## Project Context: Econ-ARK
This repository, `econ-ark-org`, is a component of the Econ-ARK project, an open-source platform for building and solving computational economic models. Understanding its role within the broader ecosystem is crucial for effective analysis.

- **Econ-ARK Website**: [https://econ-ark.org/](https://econ-ark.org/)
- **HARK Toolkit (Core Library)**: [https://github.com/econ-ark/HARK](https://github.com/econ-ark/HARK)
- **REMARKs (Replications)**: [https://github.com/econ-ark/REMARK](https://github.com/econ-ark/REMARK)

Please consult these resources to understand the relationships between the different parts of the project.

## 1. Repository Purpose

This repository contains the full source code for the official Econ-ARK project website, [https://econ-ark.org/](https://econ-ark.org/). It is built using the Jekyll static site generator. Its primary purpose is to serve as the central, public-facing hub for the Econ-ARK ecosystem, providing access to documentation, tutorials, research materials (known as "REMARKs"), and information about the project and its team. It solves the problem of aggregating and presenting a wide range of academic and software resources in a cohesive and accessible format for researchers, students, and developers.

## 2. Key Concepts and Abstractions

*   **Jekyll Site Generation**: The repository is fundamentally a Jekyll project. It uses layouts (`_layouts`), includes (`_includes`), and collections to build a static HTML website from Markdown files. Understanding Jekyll's conventions is key to understanding how content is rendered.
*   **REMARK Integration**: "REMARK" (REproducible MARKdown) is a core concept. This repository does not host the research content itself, but rather pulls it from external, standardized REMARK repositories. The `scripts/populate_remarks.py` script automates this process, fetching metadata and content and creating corresponding "material" pages on the website. This decouples content creation from website maintenance.
*   **Material as a Content Type**: The "material" (defined as a Jekyll collection in `_config.yml`) is the primary content abstraction. Each `.md` file in the `_materials` directory represents a distinct piece of research, a model, or a tutorial. These files contain rich YAML front matter that specifies metadata like authors, abstracts, and links to the source code, which is then used by the `_layouts/material.html` template to generate a standardized page.
*   **Automated Pre-processing**: The site is not just a simple collection of Markdown files. It relies on a pre-processing step, defined in `.github/workflows/site-preprocess.yml`, which runs Python scripts to fetch REMARKs and generate case-insensitive redirects before Jekyll builds the site. This automation is a key part of the repository's functionality.

## 3. Core Functionality & Key Files

*   `_config.yml`: Jekyll's main configuration file. It defines the site structure, including the crucial `materials` and `team` collections, and sets global site variables. Start here to understand the high-level structure of the Jekyll build.
*   `scripts/populate_remarks.py`: This is the most important script in the repository. It contains the logic for fetching content from the central `econ-ark/REMARK` repository and its associated sub-repositories. Understanding this file is essential to understanding how the website's content is managed and updated.
*   `_materials/`: This directory contains the local Markdown representation of each external REMARK. Examining the YAML front matter of any file in this directory is the best way to understand the metadata structure for a "material."
*   `_layouts/material.html`: This is the Jekyll template that renders the individual material pages. It shows how the metadata from the `_materials` files is transformed into HTML.
*   `.github/workflows/site-preprocess.yml`: This GitHub Actions workflow file defines the automated CI/CD pipeline. It shows how the pre-processing scripts are executed on every push to `master`, making it the entry point for the entire content update and build process.

## 4. AI Search and Analysis Strategy

- **Entry Point for Analysis**: The most effective entry point is the `.github/workflows/site-preprocess.yml` file. This workflow reveals the automated steps that build the site and points directly to the most important scripts (`populate_remarks.py` and `caseinsensitive_redirects.py`). From there, analyze `populate_remarks.py` to understand the core content aggregation logic.
- **Common Pitfalls**: Do not mistake this for a dynamic web application. It is a **statically generated site**. The Python scripts are for pre-processing and content fetching, not for handling live user requests. The large number of Markdown files in `_materials` are content, not code; the logic for how they are generated and displayed is found elsewhere.
- **Relevant Search Terms**: To find the core logic, use search terms like: "populate remarks", "REMARK", "Jekyll collection", "material layout", "GitHub Actions workflow", "parse yaml header".
