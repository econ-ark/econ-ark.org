=== HYBRID APPROACH SUCCESS SUMMARY ===
Date: Thu Jun 26 18:23:22 EDT 2025

## Problem Identified
- Aiyagari (1994) paper appeared twice on the website
- Root cause: Manual file 'Aiyagari.md' + Auto-generated 'Aiyagari-Idiosyncratic.md'

## Solution Applied: Hybrid Approach
1. ✅ Audited all material files vs REMARK catalog
2. ✅ Fixed case sensitivity issue (DistributionOfWealthMPC → DistributionofWealthMPC)
3. ✅ Removed duplicate manual Aiyagari.md file
4. ✅ Regenerated all auto-generated content

## Final State
- 📊 22 catalog entries in REMARK repository
- 📄 20 material files successfully generated (91% success rate)
- ✅ All material files now properly aligned with catalog
- ❌ 2 remaining issues requiring catalog fixes:
  - EndogeneousRetirement (name mismatch)
  - SequentialEndogenousGridMethod (name mismatch)

## Recommendations
1. Update REMARK catalog entries for the 2 name mismatches
2. Monitor daily auto-generation to prevent future duplicates
3. Consider adding validation to prevent manual/auto conflicts
