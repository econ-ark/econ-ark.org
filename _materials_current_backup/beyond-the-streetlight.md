# Abstract

This repository provides an analysis of the trend in forecast errors made by the Tealbook/Greenbook(GB) and the Survey of Professional Forecasters(SPF) for measures of the unemployment rate and real growth in personal consumption expenditures from 1982 to 2017. The data on forecasts for unemployment and consumption made by the federal reserve (Tealbook/Greenbook) and the mean across private forcasters are provided by the Philidelphia Fed. Data on realized values of the forecasted variables are provided by the St. Louis Fed.
