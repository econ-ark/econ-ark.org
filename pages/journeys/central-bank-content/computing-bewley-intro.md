A Bewley model couples many heterogeneous householdsâ€”each facing income risk and making saving, labour supply and consumption decisions. The households make their decisions by interacting in a market with firms and capital markets. Since a **distribution** of wealth, consumption, and labour supply etc., affects prices and prices affect household decisions, solving Bewley models becomes a computationally challenging **dynamic infinite dimensional fixed point problem**.
