## Section 2: Bewley Model Basics
### Why heterogeniety matters?
- Monetary Policy in a Representative-Agent Model
  - Intertemporal Substitution
  - One agent saves more
- Monetary Policy in a Heterogeneous-Agent Model
  - Low-Wealth
    - High MPC; respond to income
    - Labour Income
    - Cash-Flow
  - Middle-Wealth
    - Precautionary motive stifles response
    - Buffer-Stock Savings
  - High-Wealth
    - Low MPC; respond to prices
    - Interest Income
    - Asset Prices

### Key Implications
- Richer Policy Channels
- Distributional Effects Matter
- Calibrated with Real-World Data
