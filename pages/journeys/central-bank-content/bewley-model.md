### What's a **Bewley** Model?

**Bewley** models are the foundational framework of modern macroeconomics. Advancing from traditional representative agent models, Bewley models explicitly capture how individual differences in income, wealth, and preferences interact and aggregate to produce fluctuations in macroeconomic variables. The rigorous treatment of such models traces to Truman Bewley's work in the 1980s; modern heirs include the Krusell–Smith (1998) framework, Heterogeneous‑Agent New‑Keynesian (HANK) models, and many contemporary variants.
