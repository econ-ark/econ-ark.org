### What's a **Bewley** Model?

A **Bewley** model is the foundational framework for understanding economies with heterogeneous agents who face income uncertainty and borrowing constraints. It provides the basis for modern HANK models by showing how individual differences in income, wealth, and preferences aggregate to produce macroeconomic outcomes.

The rigorous treatment of such models traces to Truman Bewley's work in the 1980s; modern heirs include the Krusell–Smith (1998) framework, Heterogeneous‑Agent New‑Keynesian (HANK) models, and many contemporary variants.
