### Key Implications for Policymakers

* **Many Transmission Channels, One Policy Lever:** Interest rate changes affect individuals' cash-flow, income, balance-sheet and intertemporal substitution across the distribution differently; the aggregate dynamics depend on their combined effects. 
* **Heterogeneity Amplifies and Redistributes:** Shocks are magnified or dampened depending on who they hit in the wealth and income distributionâ€”policy inevitably creates both winners and losers; equity and efficiency must be weighed together.
* **Micro-Data as a Policy Input:** Instead of relying on sparse aggregate data alone, reliable, high-frequency information on households' savings, labour income and spending can be used to estimate macroeconomic models.
