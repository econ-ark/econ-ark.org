# Bewley Models for Central Banks

**Solving, estimating and simulating structural heterogeneous agent models for macroeconomic analysis**


This journey roadmap and its companion notebook are a guide to the Econ-ARK tools for solving, estimating and simulating Bewley models aimed at researchers, analysts and policymakers at central banks. 

The journey overview is targeted to a general audience, while the companion 
notebook is aimed at researchers as a detailed guide to using Econ-ARK tools. Together, their aim of this journey is to:
-  equip central bank researchers and policymakers with the tools to understand the theory and main ideas behind modern heterogenous agent macroeconomic models
- interact live with simualtions generatied using EconARK tools
- implement, and apply HANK models to monetary policy questions.
