## 1950s
### Foundations: PIH & LCH
The Permanent Income Hypothesis (Friedman) and Life-Cycle Hypothesis (Modigliani) laid the groundwork for understanding consumption behavior, but without income uncertainty. 

## 1977
### The Bewley Model
Truman Bewley introduced models with heterogeneous agents facing idiosyncratic income risk and borrowing constraints, revolutionizing how we think about macroeconomic aggregation.

## 1989-1992
### First Quantitative Models
ImrohoroÄŸlu (1989), Huggett (1993), and Aiyagari (1994) developed the first quantitative heterogeneous agent models, showing how market incompleteness affects aggregate outcomes.

## 1994
### General Equilibrium
Aiyagari's seminal paper established the general equilibrium framework for Bewley models, showing how precautionary savings affects interest rates and capital accumulation.

## 1998
### Krusell-Smith
Krusell and Smith developed methods to solve heterogeneous agent models with aggregate uncertainty, opening the door to business cycle analysis with heterogeneity.

## 2010s
### Modern HANK
The development of HANK (Heterogeneous Agent New Keynesian) models and computational tools like sequence-space Jacobians has made these models central to policy analysis at central banks worldwide.
