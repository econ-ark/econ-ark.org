abstract: We present a qualitative and quantitative analysis of the standard growth
  model modified to include precautionary saving motives and liquidity constraints.
  We address the impact on the aggregate saving rate, the importance of asset trading
  to individuals, and the relative inequality of wealth and income distributions.
