# A Two-Asset Savings Model with an Income-Contribution Scheme

This paper develops a two-asset consumption-savings model and serves as
the documentation of an open-source implementation of methods to solve and
simulate it in the HARK toolkit. The model represents an agent who can
save using two different assets---one risky and the other risk-free---to insure
against fluctuations in his income, but faces frictions to transferring funds between
assets. The flexibility of its implementation and its inclusion in the HARK
toolkit will allow users to adapt the model to realistic life-cycle calibrations, and
also to embedded it in heterogeneous-agents macroeconomic models.
