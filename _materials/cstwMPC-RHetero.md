title: Can Persistent Unobserved Heterogeneity in Returns-to-Wealth Explain Wealth
  Inequality?
---

#AksitRHetero is a Reproduction 

This is a reproduction of the results in the paper "Can Persistent Unobserved Heterogeneity in Returns-to-Wealth Explain Wealth Inequality" by Derin Aksit. 

The root directory contains two files:

"do_min.py" reproduces the version of the model with only returns-to-wealth heterogeneity 
"do_all.py" reproduces all computational results of the paper
