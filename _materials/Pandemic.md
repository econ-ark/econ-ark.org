abstract: "To predict the e\uFB00ects of the 2020 U.S. CARES Act on consumption, we\
  \ extend a model that matches responses of households to past consumption stimulus\
  \ packages. The extension allows us to account for two novel features of the coronavirus\
  \ crisis. First, during the lockdown, many types of spending are undesirable or\
  \ impossible. Second, some of the jobs that disappear during the lockdown will not\
  \ reappear when it is lifted. We estimate that, if the lockdown is short-lived,\
  \ the combination of expanded unemployment insurance bene\uFB01ts and stimulus payments\
  \ should be su\uFB03cient to allow a swift recovery in consumer spending to its\
  \ pre-crisis levels. If the lockdown lasts longer, an extension of enhanced unemployment\
  \ bene\uFB01ts will likely be necessary if consumption spending is to recover."

# Pandemic-ConsumptionResponse

This repository is a complete software archive for the paper "Modeling the Consumption Response to the CARES Act" by Carroll, Crawley, Slacalek, and White (2020). This README file provides instructions for running our code on your own computer, as well as adjusting the parameters of the model to produce alternate versions of the figures in the paper.
