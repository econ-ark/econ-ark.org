# DistributionOfWealthMPC 
The results of this paper are now generated in an updated repository using a more modern version of HARK, [DistributionOfWealth](https://github.com/econ-ark/DistributionOfWealth). Any followup work should build on the updated code in that repository.

The main results in that paper were generated using Mathematica code that can be executed by running from the command line 

`./Code/Mathematica/DoAll.m`

or by opening the corresponding notebook file `./Code/Matheamtica/DoAll.nb`

The Mathematica results have been replicated using the HARK toolkit.  See the README.md file in the repo for details.
