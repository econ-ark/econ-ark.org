message: For a consumption/saving problem with transitory and permanent shocks and
  unbounded (CRRA) utility, this paper derives conditions under which a nondegenerate
  solution exists, and under which a target wealth ratio exists; all results are paired
  with illustrative numerical solutions.

abstract: This paper builds foundations for rigorous and intuitive understanding of
  'buffer stock' saving models (Bewley (1977)-like models with a wealth target), pairing
  each theoretical result with quantitative illustrations.  After describing conditions
  under which a consumption function exists, the paper articulates stricter Growth
  Impatience' conditions that guarantee alternative forms of stability --- either
  at the population level, or for individual consumers.  Together, the numerical tools
  and analytical results constitute a comprehensive toolkit for understanding buffer
  stock models.

# BufferstockTheory
"This paper builds foundations for rigorous and intuitive understanding of `buffer stock' saving models (Bewley (1977)-like models with a wealth target), pairing each theoretical result with quantitative illustrations.  After describing conditions under which a consumption function exists, the paper articulates stricter `Growth Impatience' conditions that guarantee alternative forms of stability --- either at the population level, or for individual consumers.  Together, the numerical tools and analytical results constitute a comprehensive toolkit for understanding buffer stock models.
