abstract: 'We provide the analytical explanation of strong interactions between precautionary
  sav- ing and liquidity constraints that are regularly observed in numerical solutions
  to consump- tion/saving models. The effects of constraints and of uncertainty spring
  from the same cause: concavification of the consumption function, which can be induced
  either by constraints or by uncertainty. Concavification propagates back to consumption
  functions in prior periods. But, surprisingly, once a linear consumption function
  has been concavified by the presence of either risks or constraints, the introduction
  of additional concavifiers in a given period can reduce the precautionary motive
  in earlier periods at some levels of wealth.'

message: This paper shows that liquidity constraints and precautionary saving are
  closely related to each other, since both can be thought of is "counterclockwise
  concavifications" of the consumption function.; all results are paired with illustrative
  numerical solutions.
