abstract: "\u2018Epidemiological\u2019 models of belief formation put social interactions\
  \ at their core; such models are the main (almost, the only) tool used by non-economists\
  \ to study the dynamics of beliefs in populations. We survey the (comparatively)\
  \ small literature in which economists attempting to model the consequences of beliefs\
  \ about the future \u2013 \u2018expectations\u2019 \u2013 have employed what we\
  \ view as a full-fledged epidemiological approach to explore an economic question.\
  \ We draw connections to related work on narrative economics, news/rumor spreading,\
  \ \u2018contagion,\u2019 and the spread of online content. Finally, we discuss a\
  \ number of promising directions for future research."
